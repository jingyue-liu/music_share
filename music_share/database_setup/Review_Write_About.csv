1,4,"firmly plants Swift in the fertile ground between Shania Twain and Kelly Clarkson, though closer to the latter. Swift¡¯s marriage of pop and rock, with just a bit of country, is effortless and thrilling. Lean verses lead to explosive and exuberant choruses, with one impeccably crafted melody following another. ¡°Sparks Fly¡± may be your absolute favorite song right now, but ¡°Mean¡± or ¡°Better Than Revenge¡± will surely replace it in a couple of days.",1,64
2,5,"Taylor?has done it again, she is flawless. I love how she sings this song with so much force and emotion. Shes done it before and has done it again! Her emotion she puts into it makes me relate even more to it and intrigues me to listen. Im not sure how she makes every song she sings a hit but she does it with flying colors, i love?Taylor! All of her songs including this one are super relatable. I cannot wait until her CD with this song comes out!",2,64
3,4,One thing i noticed about this song is it sounds a little more country then the others but not too much country that its annoying for those not so big on country people. The country vibe makes it pure and sweet! It s definitely what?Taylorspecializes in.?,3,64
4,4,"This song starts out slower and gets more upbeat as it goes on. Its super catchy and only listening to it about 3 times now i know almost all the lyrics! My favorite line would have to be the part of the chorus that says,You remember we were sitting by thewater..you put your arm around me for the first time. I can totally relate to this song and that line specifically just with a personal experience i just had. ",4,64
5,2,"This is really repeative of all Taylor songs, when I hear it, it just sounds so familiar with a couple of her old sounds. Not excited about this.",5,64
6,4,"Songs like ¡®Red¡¯ add depth to the young star¡¯s catalog. As always, the magic isn¡¯t necessarily in the voice, it¡¯s in the inspired interpretation of brilliant lyrics. One hopes it won¡¯t be another eight months before Swift releases another like it.",3,49
7,4,"When I first heard about Red, I thought Tay is going to say her fav colour is red. Since my fav is red too...But nevertheless I am happy since the first song she wrote with a colour is Red....I LUVV RED..the colour and the song ^_^?",6,49
8,5,"With ¡®Pillowtalk,¡¯ Zayn makes his bid not only as a viable artist outside of One Direction, the band he?quit just 10 months ago, but also as a swoon-worthy crooner setting up stakes on the same block where?Miguel?and?Frank Ocean?live in music land.",7,87
9,3,"?There¡¯s something intrinsically ¡¯80s about the song, in that, if you strip away and forget all its surrounding Zayn-ness for just a moment ¡ª this will definitely require skipping the accompanying music video ¡ª ¡°Pillowtalk,¡± at its core, plays like a big, synth-drenched power ballad from days of yore, the likes of which folks like?Phil Collins?and?Roxette?and?Def Leppard?used to turn out.",8,87
10,2,"This route would be fine if the song somehow separated Malik from the pack. But instead of leaving an impression, we get something that sounds like if OneRepublic tried to make an ¡°edgy¡± Miguel song from 2012. Your move, Harry.",9,87
11,4,"This is a piece by the partnership of Jay and his best partner Vincent Fang, it is a modern poetic song, it gives people a refreshing feeling like a breeze. The music is like an interesting poem, it is a new idea he longed to show. This the main ballad of the album, following the success of Fine Day from the previous album, this song goes for the same formula. The song starts off very nicely with good instruments and strong verses. The song is spoiled by the average chorus, also by the fact that the chorus is repeated too often. This is a good solid song that many will like.",4,24
12,3,"Common Jasmin Orange is less successful in generating those more emotionally intense moments, opting more for a more balanced approach.",2,24
13,4,"The song is bouncy and?irresistible?to anyone who comes across it, and if you thought ¡®What Makes You Beautiful¡¯ and ¡®One Thing¡¯ were the perfect mindless and purely fun songs, then add ¡®Live While We¡¯re Young¡¯ to your list.",10,34
14,3,"This song is really fun but there are some sexual innuendos like, ""I know we've just met, but let's pretend it's love."" The chorus says, ""Tonight, let's get some! And live while we're young."" The video is really fun and clean.",13,34
